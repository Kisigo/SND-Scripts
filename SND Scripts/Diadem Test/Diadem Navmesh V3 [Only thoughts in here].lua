    * Diadem Farming V3 - Thoughts Edition  *
    *****************************************

    *************************
    *  Version -> 0.0.0.0   *
    *************************

    This is currently where me and UCanPatates can type up the thought process for WHAT we wanna do for V3 of this thing. 
        -> Maybe replace the whole thing with a while statement instead of doing a goto statement (not a bad idea)
        -> Make things more modular in the functions, easier to disect
        -> Make the random wait time a thing in it's own right (function/if statement) THAT WORKS. (never really got to implimenting this)
        -> Make a Proper Debug function to use
        -> add auto go to firmament if not there when the script starts and other checks
        -> add a materia extractor just thougs maybe be in the main loop or event trigger after every dungeon exit
        ->
