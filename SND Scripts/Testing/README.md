# Testing-SND-Scripts
This is where I mainly put all my scripts that are a WIP.

If they're here, more than likely they're not ENTIRELY finished, and still needs to be cleaned up by me/fixed up in some form or manner. 

They might get released, they might not. Some might just be test zones for other things.
