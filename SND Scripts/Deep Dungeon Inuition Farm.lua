  Authors note: TECHNICALLY if you get a Concealment, you are going to be WAY quicker on your runs. It's a 1 pom usage vs 2, which shaves off ~3 seconds per run
                And that can add up... VERY quickly. I have went through and made this as fast as I can (possibly) made it at this second.

  Quick note: thank you the two of you who kept bug fixing my things and asking for new features
              this wouldn't have gotten better w/o you buggin me in my dms

  **************
  *  Version:  *
  *  1.1.3.2   *
  **************

  Version Update Notes:
  1.1.3.2 -> make it to where sprint would toggle off upon exit
  1.1.3.1 -> Made it to where if you get spotted w/o Concealment, it'll pop a Magicite for safety
  1.1.3   -> New plugin suggestion: "Burnt Toast". Esentially saves you ~3-6 seconds per pull. 
  1.1.2   -> Forgot that floors 21-30 has a different zone ID... woops. Also, standard is now supported by default, so no need for extra menu-ing/changing control schemes
  1.1.1   -> Added tracker to tell you how many you've gotten as you farm, false by default
  1.1     -> NVM. Turns out this is faster than I could before. Updated timers again, added one before loading into NPC to make it more normalish on loadout
  1.0.4.2 -> Fixed sprint, made it constantly try to use while moving to spot
  1.0.4.1 -> Concealment save file setting added
  1.0.4   -> Speed Update (Made checking Intuition SO much faster, pomander timers as well are now fast af)
  1.0.3   -> First proper working version


  *****************
  *  Description  *
  *****************
 
  This is suppose to help you farm that stupid 10,000 Accursed Hoards Found (achievement in question: https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/achievement/7e168d23176/)
   I used HOH because it was the easiest thing to do, didn't start at a low level, and could get lucky and get a petrification in the first 10 floors
   The way this works is:
   -> Start on floor 1, run through floor 20 (kill the boss)
   -> If you don't have an intition pomander, you have some really horrible luck, reset the save file and try again.
   -> This is assuming you have one of the following:
     -> Magicite w/ safety 
       or
     -> Concealment

   -> Set the save file that is currently on floor 11 below, it'll load you in, check to see if you have an intition on that floor
   -> if it does, then it'll make a danger bongos and you have to go get it yourself, I don't have a way to map you to it (yet)
   -> if there isn't one on the floor, then it'll take you out of the DeepDungeon, and repeat the process

   -> Pandora's Box | https://love.puni.sh/ment.json
   -> VNavmesh (was last tested on 0.0.0.10) | https://puni.sh/api/repository/veyn
   -> Burnt Toast | 1PP Plugin (ty dev team)
     -> Open the config and add the following: 
       -> You can now discern the call of the Accursed Hoard.
       -> The current duty uses an independent leveling system.
       -> All the traps on this floor have disappeared!
       -> You use a splinter of Inferno magicite.
       -> You use a splinter of Crag magicite.
       -> The Beacon of Passage is activated!
       -> The Beacon of Return begins to glow!

  ManualMovement = false
  -- If an Intuition is on the floor, and out of range, do you want to still get it manually?
  -- false will leave and try to find one closer
  -- true will make it to where you are in control till you get the Intuition

  ConcealmentSaveFile = true 
  -- This setting is so you can mark off if you have concealment or not 
  -- Concealment is 100% quicker, so if you do have it in a save, would highly recommend setting this to true 
  -- if not, it'll use a primal + safety for movmement (sight doesn't really do TOO much, safety is so you don't hit a luring on the way there lol)
  -- Options: true | false 

  ChatTracker = false
  -- Option to track how many intuitions you've found over time 
  -- false by default, if you would like it to tell you upon every return back in front of the NPC, set it to true
